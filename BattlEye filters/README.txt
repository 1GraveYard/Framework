The BattlEye filters (.txt files) go into: ARMA_3_DIR → profiles → BattlEye → missionName.mapName
Example: arma3 → profiles → BattlEye → Altis_Life.Altis

These BattlEye filters are a work-in-progress and are only applicable to the most recent release of vaillia Altis Life RPG on https://github.com/ArmaLife/Altis 

Any modifications to the Altis Life RPG mission files will require the BattlEye filters to be edited.
