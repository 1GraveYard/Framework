BattlEye Filters
================
The BattlEye filters (.txt files) go into: <b>ARMA_3_DIR → profiles → BattlEye → missionName.mapName</b></br>
Example: <b>arma3 → profiles → BattlEye → Altis_Life.Altis</b></br></br>
<b>These BattlEye filters are a work-in-progress and are only applicable to the vanilla [Altis Life RPG] (https://github.com/ArmaLife/Altis)</b>.</br></br>
<b>Any modification</b> to the Altis Life RPG mission files will require the BattlEye filters to be updated.

<b>You were kicked off the game (BattlEye: Script Restriction#1)</b></br>
The mission file you are running has been modified and since a function is not whitelisted will kick you on connect.
Figure out which file you last changed and add it to the scripts.txt file. If you don't want to then remove the scripts.txt, put your fingers in your ears and say "lalalalalalal" each time you connect from now on. (Not recommended)
